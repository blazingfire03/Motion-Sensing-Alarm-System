# Motion-Sensing-Alarm-System
Arduino-based motion-sensing alarm system using PIR sensor and buzzer. Repository includes code for Arduino sketch and schematic diagram. Detects motion and triggers an audible alert upon activation
Certainly! A motion sensing alarm system using Arduino typically involves the use of a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor to detect motion and an Arduino board to process the sensor's input and trigger an alarm or alert mechanism. Here's an explanation of the project:

### Components Needed:
- **Arduino Board:** Commonly Arduino Uno, Nano, or similar.
- **PIR Sensor:** Detects motion by measuring changes in infrared radiation within its detection range.
- **Buzzer or Alarm Module:** Produces an audible alert when motion is detected.
- **Connecting Wires:** To link components on a breadboard or a prototyping board.
- **Power Source:** Typically powered through USB or an external power supply.

### Working Principle:
1. **PIR Sensor Setup:** The PIR sensor is connected to the Arduino board. It detects changes in infrared radiation within its field of view and generates a signal when motion is detected.
2. **Arduino Processing:** The Arduino continuously monitors the signal from the PIR sensor.
3. **Motion Detection:** When the PIR sensor detects motion, it sends a signal to the Arduino.
4. **Alert Activation:** Upon receiving the signal, the Arduino triggers the buzzer or alarm module to produce an alert, signaling the detection of motion.
5. **Adjustable Parameters:** The code can have adjustable settings for sensitivity and time delays to fine-tune the motion detection system.

### Project Implementation:
1. **Circuit Connection:** Set up the circuit by connecting the PIR sensor output pin to one of the digital pins on the Arduino. Connect the buzzer or alarm module to another digital pin.
2. **Arduino Programming:** Write the code in the Arduino IDE. The code reads the sensor input and activates the buzzer or alarm when motion is detected.
3. **Testing and Calibration:** Upload the code to the Arduino board and test the system. Adjust sensitivity and timing parameters in the code if needed to optimize the system's performance.
4. **Documentation:** Document the circuit connections, code explanation, and any modifications made for future reference.

### Project Outcome:
The outcome is a functional motion sensing alarm system using Arduino that can detect motion within a specified range and activate an audible alert, serving as a basic but effective security mechanism.
This project serves as a great introduction to using sensors and microcontrollers to create simple yet practical security systems.
